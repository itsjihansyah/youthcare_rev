Our website aims are to help people especially the youngster of our generation on expanding their knowledge about health, both physically and mentally. YouthCare has four main features, such as:
* Donation
* Online Pharmacy
* Podcast
* Article

In this expo we want to highlight the managerial aspect of the donation feature, which include:
* Dashboard: Overview that provides a consolidated and visual representation of key information, data, and graph for donation
* Fundraiser: Provides detail information for each donator such as name, total spending
* Donation: Detail information for each donation such as donation title, creator name, target, and total
* History: Repository of past information to explore and learn about the development of donation
